  <h1>Well, you made it.</h1>

<img src="" alt="" width="" height="">

  <h2>20 minutes late but you made it. Your history professor gives you a dirty look as the door closes noisely behind you. Your friend giggles at your embarrasment. You pray for death as you unpack your backpack, cursing the MTA the entire time.</h2>
  <p>Well you've accepted your fate and your deep seated hatred of the MTA. No matter what you do, they're always going to make you late.</p>
