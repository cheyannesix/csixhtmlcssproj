  <h2>It's about 7:00am and you've showered, eaten breakfast, and put on that outfit you've been meaning to wear. You doublecheck your backpack, which is all ready for the days scholarlly activities.
  You walk to the train station instead of jog for a change, even taking a moment to admire your reflection in the window of your local bodega. Your walk to the train station is absolutely uneventful and you're still on track to be on time,
maybe even <i>early</i> to class. The local train will be here in a minute. It'll take a little longer but you'll get a seat. The express train is in six minutes and you'll be forced to stand, but the trip will be quicker.</h2>
  <p>The local train will be a leisurely ride, but it will take a little longer. The express train will be packed, but you'll get to your destination quicker. What will you do?</p>
  <h2><a href="localchoice.html" target"_self">I deserve the leisure of a local train since I've already worked so diligently this morning.</a> </h2>
  <h2><a href="expresschoice.html" target"_self">I don't want to push my luck, I'll deal with standing on the express train.</a> </h2>
