  <h2>It arrived a few minutes behind schedule and is almost completely packed, but you think you'll be okay. You squeeze in and put your headphones, glancing down at the time ocassionally. You're not running late yet, but you're definetly pushing it.</h2>
  <h2>You're only two stops away now and a bit of your anxiety has subsided. It looks like you'll be okay. The doors open and shut in perfect time, the conductor not waiting for any turnstile straglers. You're so close.</h2>
  <h2>Only one stop now and the conductir announces that you have a sick passanger aboard and you have to waiting for EMS to arrive and take them away. You want to scream. The commuters around you chat angrily as trains running in the opposite direction pass by smoothly. For a second you actually believed you were going to be on time.
  <p>You genuiely feel bad for this sick customer, but they're really setting you up for failure. In your mind their are only two choices, since you have no idea how long this is going to take.</p>
