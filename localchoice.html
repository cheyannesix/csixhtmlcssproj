  <h1>Sweet, the train's here.</h1>

  <h2>It arrived pretty quickly and is almost completely empty. You take a seat, and put your headphones, glancing down at the time ocassionally. You're not running late yet, but you're definetly pushing it.</h2>
  <h2>You're only a few stops away now, a bit of your anxiety having subsided. It looks like you'll be okay. The doors open and shut in perfect time, the conductor not waiting for any turnstile straglers. Only four more stops.</h2>
<p><sub>Only</sub><sup>smooth</sup><sub>sailing</sub><sup>from</sup><sub>here</sub><sup>on</sup><sub>out</sub>
  <h2>Only two stops now and some jackwagon has decided to hold the door for his friend. You want to kill him. The conductor angirly announces to release the door in the back but he doesn't. An express train passes by. Great now
    they're going to merge onto the track in front of you.
  <p>This dude is really setting you up for failure. As you go to say something his friend finally makes it onto the train. If looks could kill you would have dropped them both on the spot. You think you're going to pull out but the doors spring back open, and announcement comes on the loud speaker.
  A sick passanger on the train a head of you needs medical care. You're stuck. </p>
