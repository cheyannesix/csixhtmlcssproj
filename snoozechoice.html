  <h2>It's about 7:15am and you're running even later than usual. You take the world's fastest shower, inhale some iteration of a breakfast and throw on yesterday's clothes. You grab your phone and backpack
  before running out the door. The MTA app tells you that a local train is three minutes away but the express train is eight minutes away. No matter what you hop on it will be about the same.</h2>
  <p>The local train is a bit of a longer ride but it'll be here faster. The express train will skip stops but it's further away. What do you do?</p>
  <h2><a href="localchoice.html" target"_self">I'm not chancing it, I'll get on the local since it's already here.</a></h2>
  <h2><a href="expresschoice.html" target"_self">The express train skips stops, it'll make much more sense to wait for the express</a></h2>
